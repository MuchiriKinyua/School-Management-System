## 1. Problem Statement </br>
The schoolerp project addresses the need for efficient student and parent management in schools, particularly to streamline enrollment, track student records, and facilitate parent-student connections. In many schools, these processes are manually handled, leading to inefficiencies, data errors, and difficulties in keeping stakeholders informed and engaged. </br>

Additionally, the school management system integrates with payment solutions like M-Pesa, allowing parents to make school fee payments seamlessly. However, integrating and managing these payments within an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system poses a challenge for schools without dedicated technical resources. </br>

## 2. Main Objective </br>
To develop a comprehensive school management system (schoolerp) that simplifies student enrollment, tracks student and parent information, and integrates a payment system (M-Pesa) for easy fee transactions, thus improving efficiency and reducing manual errors. </br>

## 3. Specific Objectives </br>
Student and Parent Management: Automate data entry processes for student enrollment and parent linkage, reducing manual input and ensuring data accuracy. </br>
Database Structure: Design a structured database with relevant tables and fields (e.g., student, parent, class, and teacher) to store and retrieve information efficiently. </br>
M-Pesa Integration: Integrate M-Pesa payment processing to allow easy, secure, and verifiable payment of school fees. </br>
Machine Learning Automation: Implement machine learning models to automate aspects like filling missing data, linking student-parent pairs, and gender determination for unidentified records. </br>
Data Analysis and Reporting: Provide data analytics capabilities for school administration to gain insights into student demographics, enrollment trends, and payment histories. </br>

## 4. Installation </br>
PHP 8.3 or earlier </br>
Composer </br>
Laravel 10 </br>
MySQL database server </br>
XAMPP (for Apache and MySQL) or an equivalent LAMP stack on Ubuntu </br>
M-Pesa sandbox credentials (for testing purposes) </br>

## 5. Conclusions </br>
The schoolerp project demonstrates a holistic approach to school management by integrating student and parent management with a secure, convenient payment solution. </br>
By leveraging Laravel’s capabilities and M-Pesa’s payment integration, this system offers streamlined processes, improves data accuracy, and provides reliable payment tracking, which can enhance decision-making and operational efficiency for school administrators. </br>

## 6. Recommendations </br>
Deployment: Deploy the application on a secure hosting environment (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean) to allow for remote access by authorized school staff and parents. </br>
M-Pesa Go-Live Setup: Replace the M-Pesa sandbox credentials with production credentials before launching the application for real transactions. </br>
Data Privacy and Security: Implement further measures to safeguard sensitive data, especially student, parent, and payment details, adhering to data privacy regulations. </br>
Extend Machine Learning Models: Incorporate additional ML models for predicting student performance, analyzing payment trends, and even identifying potential student dropouts. </br>
User Training and Support: Provide training sessions and documentation for end-users (teachers, admin staff) to ensure effective usage of the ERP.
